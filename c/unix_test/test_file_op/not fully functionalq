OPENVT(1)                       Linux 1.x                      OPENVT(1)

NNAAMMEE
       openvt - start a program on a new virtual terminal (VT).

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       ooppeennvvtt [-c vtnumber] [OPTIONS] [--] command

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ooppeennvvtt  will find the first available VT, and run on it the given
       ccoommmmaanndd with the given ccoommmmaanndd ooppttiioonnss,  standard  input,  output
       and  error are directed to that terminal. The current search path
       ($PATH) is used to find the requested command. If no  command  is
       specified then the environment variable $SHELL is used.

   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _-_c_, _-_-_c_o_n_s_o_l_e_=_V_T_N_U_M_B_E_R
              Use  the given VT number and not the first available. Note
              you must have write access to the supplied VT for this  to
              work;

       _-_f_, _-_-_f_o_r_c_e
              Force  opening a VT without checking whether it is already
              in use;

       _-_e_, _-_-_e_x_e_c
              Directly execute the given command, without forking.  This
              option  is  meant for use in _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_i_t_t_a_b.  If you want to
              use this feature in another context, be aware that  ooppeennvvtt
              has  to  be a session leader in order for -e to work.  See
              sseettssiidd(2) or sseettssiidd(1) on how to achieve this.

       _-_s_, _-_-_s_w_i_t_c_h
              Switch to the new VT when starting the command. The VT  of
              the new command will be made the new current VT;

       _-_u_, _-_-_u_s_e_r
              Figure  out  the owner of the current VT, and run login as
              that user.  Suitable to be called by  init.  Shouldn't  be
              used with -c or -l;

       _-_l_, _-_-_l_o_g_i_n
              Make  the  command  a login shell. A - is prepended to the
              name of the command to be executed;

       _-_v_, _-_-_v_e_r_b_o_s_e
              Be a bit more verbose;

       _-_w_, _-_-_w_a_i_t
              wait for command to  complete.  If  -w  and  -s  are  used
              together  then  ooppeennvvtt will switch back to the controlling
              terminal when the command completes;

       _-_V_, _-_-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n
              print program version and exit;

       _-_h_, _-_-_h_e_l_p
              show this text and exit.

       _-_-     end of options to ooppeennvvtt.

NNOOTTEE
       If ooppeennvvtt is compiled with a getopt_long() and you  wish  to  set
       options to the command to be run, then you must supply the end of
       options -- flag before the command.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       ooppeennvvtt can be used to start a shell on the next free VT, by using
       the command:

       _o_p_e_n_v_t _b_a_s_h

       To start the shell as a login shell, use:

       _o_p_e_n_v_t _-_l _b_a_s_h

       To get a long listing you must supply the -- separator:

       _o_p_e_n_v_t _-_- _l_s _-_l

HHIISSTTOORRYY
       Earlier,  ooppeennvvtt  was  called  ooppeenn.  It was written by Jon Tombs
       <jon@gtex02.us.es or jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>.  The -w idea  is  from
       "sam".
